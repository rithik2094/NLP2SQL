## NLP to SQL
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) based system that converts human-readable queries into structured SQL statements.

## Overview
This project enables users to query databases using natural language. It utilizes pre-trained NLP models to translate human-readable queries into SQL, making database interaction more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Features
✅ Convert natural language queries into SQL statements
✅ Support for various SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
✅ Pre-trained NLP models for query generation
✅ Database execution support
✅ FastAPI-powered REST API

## Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI, Python
NLP Model: Transformer-based models (T5, BERT, GPT)
Database: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL
Libraries: Transformers, FastAPI, Uvicorn

## Usage
API Endpoint
POST /query/
Input: A natural language query
Output: Corresponding SQL query and execution result

## Future Enhancements
Multi-database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
Enhanced NLP model fine-tuning
Web-based UI for query execution
